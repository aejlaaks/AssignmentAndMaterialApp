# Caching Strategy Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the caching improvements implemented in the application.

## 1. Implemented Caching Utilities

We created a comprehensive set of caching utilities in `src/utils/cacheUtils.ts`:

- LocalForage-based persistent storage
- Functions for storing and retrieving cached items
- Cache invalidation utilities with detailed logging
- Specialized utilities for invalidating course-specific caches

## 2. Enhanced API Client

We updated the API client with:

- Support for axios-extensions caching adapter
- Throttling to prevent excessive API requests
- Configurable caching through request flags

## 3. Updated Service Layer

We refactored the service layer to:

- Use a consistent OOP approach with proper class structure
- Add comprehensive caching for all major API requests
- Ensure consistent data structures (especially for arrays)
- Implement fallback mechanisms when API data is inconsistent

## 4. Key Features Implemented

### Material Service Improvements:
- `getAllMaterials()` now caches results and handles non-array responses
- `getMaterialsByCourse()` caches course-specific materials
- `getMaterialsForCourses()` efficiently retrieves materials for multiple courses
- `getMaterialContent()` caches binary content to avoid repeated downloads

### Assignment Service Improvements:
- `getAssignments()` now uses caching for all assignments
- `getAssignmentsByCourse()` caches course-specific assignments
- `getAssignmentsForCourses()` efficiently retrieves assignments for multiple courses
- Proper handling of duplicate assignments when fetching from multiple sources

### Dashboard Optimization:
- Student dashboard now correctly shows only relevant materials and assignments
- Data fetching is optimized with local filtering instead of multiple API calls
- Assignment and material counts are now accurate for student roles

## 5. Performance Benefits

- Reduced API calls for frequently accessed data
- Faster loading times for returning users
- Lower bandwidth usage (especially for binary content)
- Better error resilience through local fallbacks
- More accurate representation of user data

## 6. Future Improvements

- Implement Time-To-Live (TTL) for cached items
- Add versioning for cache entries to handle schema changes
- Consider implementing offline capabilities with Service Workers
- Add more granular cache invalidation for specific items
