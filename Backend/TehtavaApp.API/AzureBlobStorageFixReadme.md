# Azure Blob Storage URL Handling Fix

## Overview

This document explains the fixes implemented for handling Azure Blob Storage URLs in both the `MaterialController` and `FilesController`. These changes address the "NotFound - The specified resource does not exist" errors that were occurring in the production environment when accessing files stored in Azure Blob Storage.

## Problem

When files are stored in Azure Blob Storage, their URLs contain the full path information (including the container and folder structure). When these URLs are stored directly in the database and later accessed, the system was attempting to use these full URLs as paths within the blob storage system, leading to "NotFound" errors.

For example, if a file URL was:
```
https://tehtavatblocproduction.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/materials/12345.pdf
```

The system was trying to access this exact URL as a path, rather than extracting just the filename and using the correct container path.

## Solution

The fix involves:

1. Adding helper methods to both controllers to handle Azure Blob Storage URLs
2. Detecting when a URL is from Azure Blob Storage
3. Extracting just the filename from the URL
4. Constructing the correct path within the current container
5. Using the Azure Blob Storage SDK directly instead of HTTP requests

## Implementations

### MaterialController

- Added `HandleAzureBlobUrl` helper method
- Updated `GetMaterialContent`, `GetMaterialContentByUrl`, and `GetPublicMaterialContent` methods to detect Azure Blob Storage URLs and handle them accordingly

### FilesController (for Assignment Files)

- Added `HandleAzureBlobUrl` helper method
- Updated `DownloadFile` method to detect Azure Blob Storage URLs and handle them accordingly

## Benefits

These changes provide the following benefits:

1. **Reliability**: Eliminates the "NotFound" errors when accessing files
2. **Performance**: Direct access to Azure Blob Storage is faster than HTTP requests
3. **Security**: Prevents potential security issues related to redirecting to external URLs
4. **Maintainability**: Consistent approach to handling Azure Blob Storage URLs across the application

## Implementation Details

The helper methods extract the filename from the Azure Blob Storage URL and use it to construct a correct path within the local container, ensuring that files can be accessed consistently regardless of how their URL is stored in the database.

This approach is compatible with existing data and doesn't require any database migration or URL conversion.
