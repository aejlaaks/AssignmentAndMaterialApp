# Backend Documentation

## Architecture and Implementation

The backend follows a service-oriented architecture built with .NET. The key components include:

### Controllers
- RESTful API endpoints organized by domain entity
- Handle HTTP requests and delegate business logic to services
- Return standardized responses

### Services
- Implement business logic independent of HTTP concerns
- Interact with repositories for data access
- Handle error cases and validation

### Data Access
- Repository pattern for database operations
- Entity models with navigation properties for relationships
- Uses Entity Framework Core for ORM capabilities

### Storage Services
- `AzureBlobStorageService` for handling file uploads
- Secure access to stored files
- File metadata management

## Key Design Decisions

### Service Layer Pattern
- **What**: Business logic lives in dedicated service classes
- **Why**: Separation of concerns, enables unit testing
- **Example**: `MaterialService` implements operations on materials

### Cloud Storage Integration
- **What**: Azure Blob Storage for file storage
- **Why**: Scalable solution for storing user-uploaded content
- **Example**: Methods for generating URLs and managing storage containers

### Authentication
- **What**: JWT-based authentication
- **Why**: Stateless authentication suitable for API services
- **Example**: Token validation in request pipeline

### Resource Hierarchy
- **What**: Resources organized hierarchically (courses contain materials, assignments)
- **Why**: Reflects real-world relationships and simplifies access control
- **Example**: Endpoints like `/course/{id}/materials`

## Areas for Improvement

### Error Handling
- Inconsistent null handling in several services
- Consider using Result pattern or nullable reference types more effectively
- Implement global exception handling middleware

### Field Validation
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Use data annotations or FluentValidation for consistent validation rules
- Ensure client receives clear validation error messages

### API Documentation
- Implement Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Document expected request/response formats
- Generate client SDKs for frontend consumption

### Performance
- Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries (missing indexes, N+1 query problems)
- Consider implementing batch operations for bulk changes

### Security
- Audit authorization logic
- Implement resource-based permissions
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Testing
- Expand unit test coverage
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Implement automated testing for critical workflows
